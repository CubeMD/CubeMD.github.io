I am a machine learning enthusiast striving to bring intelligent systems into game development. I enjoy creating games as well as solving them with machine learning.

I took the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree with Udacity and read books on Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and Math to lay the foundation of my knowledge. I spend all my spare time looking for interesting papers and projects to keep myself up-to-date with these constantly evolving fields. Over the years, I have acquired a large collection of noteworthy projects, which I am always happy to talk about and want to share with the community in the near future. I apply my knowledge to different projects that I'm either doing myself or volunteering for, and I always try to put emphasis on learning something new.

My area of expertise is the design of reinforcement learning environments with game engines, primarily Unity. I have been using the ML-Agents toolkit since it was in early beta and thoroughly studied the intricacies of communicating information between the game engines and python, as well as the training algorithms themselves. I experimented with applying reinforcement learning to various games and quickly learned that the design of the way that the agent interacts with the world is a crucial but often overlooked part of reinforcement learning. I make custom sensors, action and reward systems, and lay out the decision-making process to make agents that behave in the desired ways.

I am interested in bringing my experience outside of game engines too. Deep Learning is an incredibly interesting topic on its own. Its mathematical background is fascinating, and Python, Tensorflow, and PyTorch are tools that I also know.

## Background

I started learning about how video games work in high school. Back then, I used to host heavily modded servers for games like Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Killing Floor 2, and, of course, Minecraft. Digging in the files, figuring out how it all works and seeing a small community form around my servers brought me joy and encouraged me to keep learning.

Even though I was planning to pursue education in programming, due to circumstances, I ended up in the field of hospitality business and management. Working in operations and constantly dealing with people was new to me, and I believe that it taught me important social skills that serve me well to this day.

After I got my diploma in 2018, I started learning about video game development with Unreal Engine, at first as a hobby, but I quickly fell in love with it. I always liked science, and game development quickly showed me how much I missed working with software. I spent some time learning about different parts of game engines and learned some C++, but I have been blown away by the simplicity of the Blueprints and how much and how quickly can be achieved with them. I signed up for a week-long in-person course on Unreal Engine, where I met similar-minded people, did a few projects with them, and it became a point when I decided that this is what I would like to do professionally.

I noticed the field of machine learning around the same time, and it immediately caught my attention. The achievements of OpenAI and DeepMind were astounding, and I used my game development and programming skills to create my own small neuroevolution project. It was also the time when I first learned about connecting game engines to Python and wrote my first lines of Tensorflow code.

To make it a full-time job, I enrolled in a Game Design and Development programme at Centennial College in Toronto. The programme covered all aspects of game development in Unity, and I put emphasis on learning C# and Deep Reinforcement Learning. During my studies, I took part in various game jams and projects and tried to learn something new every time.

There were 30 I and 22 learned throughout this text.
